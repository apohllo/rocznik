# Rocznik Kognitywistyczny submission system

This is an application based on Ruby on Rails and Storytime used to run the
http://rocznik.kognitywistyka.eu website. It's a scientific article submission
system used by "Rocznik Kognitywistyczny" journal.

It combines minimalistic CMS (Storytime) with simple article submission system.
The primary aim of the system is to track the review process and produce stats
required by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education.

## Requirements

The dependencies are defined in the Gemfile. We assume Ruby version 2.0 is
required to develop the system.
